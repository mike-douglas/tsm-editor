# Contributing to TSM editor

We love your input and feedback! I want to make contributing to this project easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

* Reporting a bug,
* Dsicussing the current state of the code,
* Submitting a fix,
* Proposing new features,
* Becoming a maintainer

This document should hopefully describe how to contribute to this project.

## Developing in Github

This project uses Github to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

## Code changes and automation

Pull requests automatically run unit tests using Github Flow on the proposed changes, so I welcome any contribution as long as it follows these steps:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from the main branch,
2. Changes to the code base should also include unit tests and functional tests where possible,
3. Ensure that the tests pass,
4. Ensure that the code follows linting standards,
5. Issue the pull request!

## Licensing

Any changes you make should follow the MIT Software License

## Reporting bugs

Reporting bugs is done using the template provided by Github issues found [here](https://github.com/mike-douglas/tsm-editor/issues/new/choose)
