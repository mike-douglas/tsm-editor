## What is this?

This tool is a Custom String editor for the [TradeSkillMaster][tsm] addon for the game World of Warcraft.

Custom Strings are tools that let you customize the behavior of how the TSM addon operates. They are written in a formula language that uses functions, price sources, and value sources, kind of like a fancy Excel formula. You can read more about them at the [TSM Knowledgebase Article about Custom Strings][strings].

This website is not maintained by the [TradeSkillMaster][tsm] team or product, so if you have support questions regarding the user of the tools on this site, please reach out by filing a [GitHub Issue][issue]. It is a tool created for the WoW goldmaking community by a fellow goldmaker.

## Why does this tool exist?

This tool is an offline editor for Custom Strings, meaning that you don't need to use the in-game [TradeSkillMaster][tsm] tools for writing Custom Strings! It also has some other useful features:

* **Sharable Links:** The custom string you're working on can be bookmarked for later or shared with others by copying the URL right in your browser
* **Enhanced Editor:** The editor has features similar to an IDE you'd use to write code; it has auto-complete features and syntax highlighting that helps give you everything you need in one place to write custom strings
* **Reference:** The site also has a searchable reference of all of the current TSM Price Sources, Value Sources, and Functions

## Contributing
