The TSM Custom String Editor is a web-based tool for creating and sharing pricing strings for the TSM addon in World of Warcraft. You can think of this thing kind of like an Excel formula bar for TSM. It provides a function/variable reference and syntax highlighting, and the URLs are sharable.

It is deployed on Github Pages, so it can be accessed at [http://directive.io/tsm-editor/](http://directive.io/tsm-editor/).
